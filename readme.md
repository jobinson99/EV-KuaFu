### Version

- v201812 barebone
- v20190504 add Solar Energy roof, Reforming the Skeleton.
- v201909 in order to quicker assembling, the skeleton shift to cold-formed thin-walled steel, link with screw bolt
- v201911 modify the single vehicle to main carrier with one or more trailer.
- vz backup electrical system, backup brake, thermal system, renovation of the operation system, fiber enhanced resin.

Actually, 3 version provided:
- commonly implemented, steel.
- [recommanded]main carrier with trailer, steel. Practical, easy implemented, fast assembling, cost-less, extensible.
- main carrier with trailer, fiber enhanced.
